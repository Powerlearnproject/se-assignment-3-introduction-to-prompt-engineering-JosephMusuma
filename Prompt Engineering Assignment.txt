Context: "...about renewable energy advancements..." This provides background information on the topic, helping the AI understand the subject matter.
Constraints: "...in three sentences." This limits the length of the summary, ensuring conciseness.

#Types of Prompts:
Describe different types of prompts (e.g., open-ended prompts, instructional prompts). How does the type of prompt influence the AI model's response? 
Open-Ended Prompts: These prompts ask broad questions or give general instructions without specific constraints, encouraging a wide range of responses. Eg. "What are your thoughts on the future of technology?"
Instructional Prompt:These prompts request the AI to provide detailed instructions or explanations on how to perform a task. Example: "Explain how to bake a chocolate cake."
Clarification Prompts: These prompts ask the AI to clarify or elaborate on a previous statement or concept. Example: "Can you clarify what you mean by 'sustainable development'?"
Analytical Prompts: These prompts ask the AI to perform an in-depth examination or critique of a topic. Eg. "Analyze the impact of social media on youth culture."
Role-Specific Prompts: These prompts ask the AI to assume a specific role or perspective in its response. Eg. "As a doctor, explain the importance of a balanced diet."

The type of prompt directly shapes the AI's response by providing specific instructions, context, and expectations:
Open-Ended Prompts: Encourage creativity and exploration, resulting in diverse and varied responses.
Instructional Prompts: Lead to structured and precise information, focusing on clear instructions and explanations.
Clarification Prompts: Drive the AI to provide more detailed and specific information, refining its initial responses.
Completion Prompts: Generate concise, contextually appropriate completions, often reflecting common themes.
Comparative Prompts: Produce balanced analyses, highlighting similarities and differences.
Analytical Prompts: Lead to thorough, detailed, and nuanced examinations of topics.
Role-Specific Prompts: Tailor the response to a particular perspective or expertise, offering specialized advice.
Conversational Prompts: Create engaging and interactive dialogue, maintaining a natural conversational flow.
Persuasive Prompts: Construct compelling arguments aimed at persuading or convincing the audience.
Descriptive Prompts: Focus on vivid and detailed descriptions, creating clear imagery through language.

#Prompt Tuning:
What is prompt tuning, and how does it differ from traditional fine-tuning methods? Provide a scenario where prompt tuning would be advantageous. 
Prompt tuning is a technique in the field of natural language processing (NLP) where the focus is on optimizing the prompts given to a pre-trained language model to elicit better performance on specific tasks. In contrast, Traditional Fine-Tuning involves updating the parameters of the pre-trained model on a specific dataset. This typically requires a substantial amount of task-specific data and computational resources.
Scenario: Imagine a company wants to deploy a customer support chatbot that can handle various types of customer inquiries, such as order tracking, product information, and troubleshooting. The company has a large pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-4) but does not have the resources or time to fine-tune the model for each specific type of inquiry.

Role of Context in Prompts:
Explain the role of context in designing effective prompts. How can adding or omitting context affect the output of an AI model? 
Context in prompts refers to the additional information or background details provided to the AI model to help it understand the task better. It plays a crucial role in guiding the AI to produce accurate, relevant, and coherent responses. The context can include details about the topic, the specific task requirements, examples, and any constraints or formatting guidelines

#Ethical Considerations in Prompt Engineering:
